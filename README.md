# passwordGenerator

## This application creates a password within selected parimeters given by user input.

This application was created using:
*HTML
*CSS
*JavaScript

When the user selects 'Generate Password' on the page, it will prompt the user for several confirms. Whether or not they would like uppercase characters, lowercase characters, symbols, and numbers. Should a user not wish to select one of the aforementioned paramiters, I have added the values by default; as it was a requirement for this project.

Once generated, the user will have the option to copy the password to their clipboard for easy storing.

This project is housed on [GitHub Pages](https://electrovert.github.io/passwordGenerator/.).
